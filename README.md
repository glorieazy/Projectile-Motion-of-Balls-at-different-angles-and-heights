#### Projectile-Motion-of-Balls-at-different-angles-and-heights

'''

    - Introduction: 
    This project simulates and visualizes the paths of three projectiles 
    launched at distinct angles at ground level and prescribed height, and returning to 
    the ground.

    - Aim:
    The project utilizes basic physics equations to calculate the trajectory of each projectile, 
    taking into account only the gravitational force acting on them. The resulting visualizations 
    provide an insightful representation of how height influences the path of projectiles of 
    complementary angles (theta, 90-theta).

    - Customization and Exploration:
    Users can easily customize parameters like launch angle, initial velocity, and gravity to observe
    their impact on the trajectories. This flexibility encourages exploration and experimentation 
    with different scenarios.

    - Insight:
    1. The trajectory symmetry reflects the fact that complementary angles have similar horizontal range
    2. Higher launch angles (closer to 90 degrees) result in a longer time of flight
    
    Conclusively, the insights gained can be extended to real-world scenarios, such as understanding 
    the optimal launch angle for a projectile in sports or engineering applications.
